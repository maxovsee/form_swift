# form_swift
Ditch web browsers and PDF readers. This app can retrieve all embedded fields from a pdf-form and display them as entries in a compact window, allowing users to fill them out more easily than within the form using web browser or a PDF reader. You will be asked if you'd like to open the pdf from a web link or locally. Once the entries are completed, they can be saved back to the PDF file selected by the user. Itâ€™s very straightforward and quick. The code is open to even further customization.
